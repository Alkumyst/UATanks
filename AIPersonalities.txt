AI Personality Types:

Hunter: Relentlessly hunts down player. Starts in the idle state, waits a set time (will enter seekPlayer state) or until an enemy tank is in hearing or sight range. If the enemy is “seen” the Hunter will enter the seekAndShoot state until line of sight is lost. In which case, it will change to the seekPlayer state. If the hunter is in the idle state and an enemy is within hearing range and is making noise, the hunter will change to the seekPlayer state until the enemy is within line of sight. Once in sight, it will change to the seekAndShoot state. This tank should not enter the following states: patrol, shoot, patrolAndShoot, or fleePlayer. If it enters one of these states, after a few seconds it will default to the idle state.
	
Defender: Doesn't move until enemy tank is heard or seen. Starts in the idle state, waits until an enemy is within sight or hearing range. When an enemy is heard the Defender will enter the seekPlayer state until a line of sight is made (it will switch to the seekAndShoot state) or until a set time has passed (it will enter the patrol state). In the seekAndShoot state, the Defender will attack the player for a set time and will change to the patrol state. In the patrol state, the Defender will attempt to return to its origin point within a set time. If it makes it to the point, it re-enters the idle state. If too much time has passed before it returns to the point, it will enter the idle state where it is and wait for an enemy to move into range. This tank should not enter the following states: shoot, patrolAndShoot, or fleePlayer. If it enters one of these states, after a few seconds it will default to the idle state.

Fleer: Will hunt player, when in range will shoot once, then flee, and repeat. Starts in the idle state, waits a set time (will enter seekPlayer state) or until an enemy tank is in hearing or sight range. If the enemy is "seen" or "heard" Fleer will enter the seekPlayer state. While in the seekPlayer state, once Fleer moves within a certain range of the target it will switch to the shoot state. In the shoot state, Fleer will shoot once then change to the fleePlayer state. After a set flee time, Fleer will switch to the seekPlayer state and resume its hunt. This tank should not enter the following states: patrol, patrolAndShoot, or seekAndShoot. If it enters one of these states, after a few seconds it will default to the idle state.

Patroller: Patrols the edge of the map until an enemy is seen. Starts in idle, waits a set amount of time (will enter patrol state) or until an enemy tank is in hearing or sight range. If the enemy is “seen” the Patroller will enter the seekAndShoot state until the enemy move out of the attack radius or a set amount of time passes. In which case, it will enter the patrol state. If the hunter is in the idle state and an enemy is within hearing range and is making noise, the hunter will change to the seekPlayer state until the enemy is within line of sight (will switch to seekAndShoot) or a set amount of time passes (will enter patrol state). In the patrol state, the Patroller will patrol around the edge of the map until the enemy is within sight or hearing range. In which case, it follows the same rules as in the idle state. This tank should not enter the following states: shoot, patrolAndShoot, or fleePlayer. If it enters one of these states, after a few seconds it will default to the idle state.
